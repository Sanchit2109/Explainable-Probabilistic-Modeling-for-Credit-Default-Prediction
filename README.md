🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to build an explainable and probabilistic machine learning system to predict the Probability of Default (PD) for loan applicants using diverse financial and behavioral data.
Unlike traditional credit scoring systems that operate as black boxes or provide simple accept/reject outputs, this system:
Produces calibrated probability estimates
Explains decisions using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques
Categorizes applicants into risk buckets
Provides actionable guidance via a customer-support chatbot
The goal is to enhance trust, transparency, and decision quality in automated lending systems.
