🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to build an explainable and probabilistic machine learning system to predict the Probability of Default (PD) for loan applicants using diverse financial and behavioral data.

Unlike traditional credit scoring systems that operate as black boxes or provide simple accept/reject outputs, this system:

Produces calibrated probability estimates

Explains decisions using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques

Categorizes applicants into risk buckets

Provides actionable guidance via a customer-support chatbot

The goal is to enhance trust, transparency, and decision quality in automated lending systems.

🎯 Problem Statement

Existing credit scoring systems often suffer from:

Limited predictive accuracy

Lack of interpretability

Poor probability calibration

No feedback for rejected or high-risk applicants

This project proposes a unified solution that combines:

✔ heterogeneous financial features
✔ probabilistic modeling
✔ explainable AI
✔ and an intelligent assistance chatbot

to create a user-centric and regulator-friendly credit risk platform.
